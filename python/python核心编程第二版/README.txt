README

"Core Python Programming", 2nd Edition, by Wesley J. Chun

These directories contain all of the source code for the
applications in the book, e.g., Example x.y, with each
directory representing the code for a chapter in the book
which features at least one code Example.

In each directory, you may also find a subdirectory named
"alt" which will contain alternative source code.  These
can include:

- Applications that have been more fully-commented
- Some of the more lengthy code snippets featured as
    chapter reading
- Modified applications which run on older (or newer)
    versions of Python

Also be sure to check out the COLOPHON.txt, COPYRIGHT.txt,
and LICENSE.txt files.  The "ls-lFR.txt" file contains a
fully-recursive directory listing.  The "all.zip" and
"all.tgz" files represent snapshots of everything here.
