# so which object owns these methods, anyhow? 
# The following test reveals all...
print( "The 'free standing methods' in this code belong to an object named: " )
puts( self )
print( "which is an instance of the class: " )
puts( self.class )

#Free-standing methods (like those above which are not defined within a 
#specific class) become methods (strictly speaking, 'private' methods) of
#the Object class. Ruby creates the 'main' object automatically. 
#The following code displays a sorted list of the private methods available 
#to the main object. Look carefully and you will find showname, return_name 
# and return_name2 in that list. 
puts( "It contains these private methods: " )
puts( self.private_methods.sort )

#Just to prove that these methods are actually bound into the Object class
#itself, uncomment the code below and you will see that showname, return_name 
#and return_name2 can also be found among the Object class's private methods!
#

# puts( Object.private_methods.sort )
